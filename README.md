# ical2discord Import your ICal events to Discord
# Pre-Alpha Notice
This bot is not production ready and lacks **a lot** of features.

## Why?
Because I haven't found any bot capable of importing events  from a calendar to Discord. So I made one.

## How?
Should be simply as [adding the bot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096083464123584562&permissions=17600776030208&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and start prompting it with /help to get further instructions
